# Description
In this project, we must implement our own 3D game, using the miniLibX library.<br>
The rules of the game are as followed:<br>
- The game must take as a first argument a ".cub" file, which contains the map and some options.<br>
- The map must be composed of only 7 possible characters:<br>
  - 0 for an empty cell<br>
  - 1 for a wall<br>
  - N for the player's starting position, facing north<br>
  - W for the player's starting position, facing west<br>
  - S for the player's starting position, facing south<br>
  - E for the player's starting position, facing east<br>
- The map must be closed/surrounded by walls.<br>
- The map may contain space characters, which are considered as void cells.<br>
- The player can move using the W, A, S and D keys.<br>
- The player can rotate using the left and right arrow keys.<br>
- The player can quit the game by pressing the ESC key, or by clicking the top-right cross.<br>
